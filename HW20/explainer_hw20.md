## Document how to run the program you created in question 1 in a readme.md file in your repo. Be as clear as possible. Use proper markdown, and consider using screenshots. Be sure to briefly discuss why this kind of exercise might be helpful for NLP in your markdown. 

There're 2 ways that you can run the program from question1:
* from a terminal within the Visual Studio Code
* from a regular terminal

### 1. Option 1: run it from a terminal within the Visual Studio Code

1. within the visual studio code, click Terminal(at the top) --> New Terminal.
